Honors Thesis Repository

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository holds all my work for my honors thesis: Identification of the Inertial Parameters of Manipulator Payloads. It contains MATLAB code to simulate a two link manipulator in joint space, a 5th order trajectory generator for said manipulator, and the Least squares identification method for identifying the payload.
